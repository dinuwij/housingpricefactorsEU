# Housing Price Factor Analysis for Southern Europe

This individual project was created using various python libraries for the Financial Programming module. 
It is created to provide useful insights on trends on housing prices and to identify factors impacting such price changes in Southern Europe.
It has used Jupyter notebook to develop as it is presentable and easy to use. Visualization is provided using Dash Plotly. All the data files used and which can be used in the project is available under 'data' folder.

Feel free to provide feedback on the project as I intend to improve it further with time.
